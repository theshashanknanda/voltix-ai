# ⚡ Voltix AI

Voltix AI is an intelligent web-based assistant designed to help developers understand, maintain, and improve existing codebases. Instead of focusing on generating new code, Voltix AI emphasizes **code comprehension, onboarding support, maintainability insights, and documentation quality**.

Modern software projects often suffer from poor documentation, inconsistent coding standards, and high onboarding costs for new developers. Voltix AI addresses these challenges by analyzing a project’s codebase and providing **context-aware explanations, quality recommendations, and AI-generated documentation** through a developer-friendly web interface.

## 🚀 Motivation

Developers frequently spend significant time understanding unfamiliar codebases, especially in large or legacy systems. Documentation is often outdated, and critical knowledge is spread across senior team members.

Existing tools such as linters, documentation generators, and AI coding assistants provide partial solutions, but they typically lack:
- Context-aware explanations tailored to a specific codebase
- Onboarding-focused guidance for new developers
- Ongoing maintainability and quality insights

Voltix AI is designed to bridge this gap by acting as an intelligent guide for both individuals and development teams.

- Provide clear, AI-generated explanations of code structure and logic
- Identify maintainability issues and code quality concerns
- Generate and maintain up-to-date documentation from source code
- Offer a scalable and developer-friendly web platform

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

This repository currently focuses on **requirements analysis and Agile planning**.

- All system functionality is captured as **user stories** in GitHub Issues
- User stories are grouped under **epics**
- A single milestone, **Product Backlog**, represents the full scope of the system
- Each user story includes:
  - Description
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - Testing Scenarios

Implementation will be developed in later phases.
